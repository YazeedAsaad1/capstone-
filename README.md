    User ||--o{ List : "owns"
    
    User {
        int id PK
        string username
        string email
        string password
        datetime date_joined
        boolean is_active
    }
    
    List {
        int id PK
        string task
        datetime date
        text description
        boolean is_complete
        int user_id FK
    }
```

### Model Relationships:
- **User** (Django's built-in User model)
  - One user can have many tasks (One-to-Many relationship)
  - Handles authentication and user management

- **List** (Task model)
  - Each task belongs to one user
  - Contains task details: name, due date, description, completion status
  - Foreign key relationship to User model
